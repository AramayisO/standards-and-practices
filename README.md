# standards-and-practices

##Reason for Repo

* We are trying to set minimal standards for shift3/Bitwise projects.
* Have a central repository where other shift3/Bitwise members can share knowledge of best practices. 
* Have a reference point to start a new project or answer questions on different topics.
