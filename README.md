# Standards and Practices

## Reason for Repo

* We are trying to set minimal standards for Shift3/Bitwise projects.
* Have a central repository where other Shift3/Bitwise members can share knowledge of best practices. 
* Have a reference point to start a new project or answer questions on different topics.

## IF SOMETHING IS MISSING OR INCOMPLETE, SUBMIT AN ISSUE PLEASE!

When submitting readme edits, use this [Github-flavored Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

### If you want to contribute, here's how:
1. Assign the issue for the change to yourself
  * If there is no issue, create one.
    * If you need to submit an issue, make sure the name is descriptive but brief, and in the comments, give a details, enumerated summary of what you hope to accomplish and how it will add value to the team.
      > If you can't think of a way it will benefit the team, cease and desist!
2. Clone the repository and create a new branch following the guidline __issueNumber-yourInitials__
  * Example: 17-rh
3. Write out a clear, concise .md file on your topic of choice, or edit one that has fallen out of currency or needs to be updated. Make sure you use the Markdown Cheatsheet linked above as a guidline.
4. Push your code and create a PR, tagging one of the admins in the comments.
5. Once approved, close the PR and delete your branch.

### Code of Conduct
1. No cussing, we're beyond that
2. Keep the requests and issues professional and relevant to the work we're doing at Shift3/Bitwise
3. Treat others with the same respect you would if you were talking to them in person. Don't be a jerk.
4. Have fun and share your knowledge!

#### This repository will never become a standard we can rely on if we don't keep it active and up-to-date..

Every little bit that adds to the conversation will benefit us all tremendously.
