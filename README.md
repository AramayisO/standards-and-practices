# standards-and-practices

##Reason for Repo

* We are trying to set minimal standards for shift3/Bitwise projects.
* Have a central repository where other shift3/Bitwise members can share knowledge of best practices. 
* Have a reference point to start a new project or answer questions on different topics.

## IF SOMETHING IS MISSING OR INCOMPLETE, SUBMIT AN ISSUE PLEASE!

####This repository will never become a standard we can rely on if we don't keep it active and up-to-date..

Every little bit that adds to the conversation will benefit us all tremendously.
