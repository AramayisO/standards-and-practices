# Code Versioning

### What is versioning?

Ever used NPM before? How about Homebrew, or RubyGems? Each of those and most other package management systems need a way of keeping track of what version their public codebase is on, what versions they have had before, and what version they are heading toward.

The three package management systems I mentioned above all use a system of organization called [**Symantic Versioning**](https://www.jvandemo.com/a-simple-guide-to-semantic-versioning/) to maintain uniform control of their code and how it is recieved by thier users. In short, versioning helps code maintainers and users of open source code identify several aspects of the code in question.
