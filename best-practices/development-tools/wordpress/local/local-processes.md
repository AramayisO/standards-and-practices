# Local by Flywheel Workflow Processes

### Pulling down latest changes and database from staging or development site.

This process will be relevant when development team needs to update their database on their local machine.  

(ie. To ensure everybody has the same copy, images, plugins, pages etc.) 

##### Notes 

-   Local by Flywheel is referring to WP Deployment tool. 
-   Local Machine is referring to your computer.

1. Commit any changes you are currently working on in your branch.
2. Checkout into development branch.
3. Pull from Local by Flywheel (within local dashboard), make sure to check mark the box that says "include database".
4. Check to see if changes are accurately reflected on your local machine. 
5. Git Pull within development to update any recent changes in codebase.
