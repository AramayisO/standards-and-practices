### Sign up

At Shift3 we utilize MongoDB's managed cloud database system [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas). If you are a developer on a MongoDB project, you should have been given access to Shift3's account with MongoDB Atlas. If you weren't please contact Corey Shuman (cshuman@shift3tech.com) to have your email account added.

Once you are signed up and are able to log in, make sure you enable 2Factor Authentication for your account. This set is **NOT OPTIONAL**.
